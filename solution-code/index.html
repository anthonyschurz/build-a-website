    	<p>Hello! My name is Anthony Schurz and I want to become a developer. Here's a little about myself to help you understand why I want to program. Ready to check out my portfolio? Go <a href="portfolio.html" target="_blank">here</a> and take a look :)</p>

    	<h3>Early Life</h3>
    	<p>I was born in Roanoke, Virginia, on February 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1990, the son of Todd and Stephanie Schurz. After a brief stint in Palm Springs, my family moved to South Bend, Indiana, where my Dad served as the editor of the local newspaper. In South Bend, I developed a love for writing, science, debate, and soccer. I also loved building things - whether it was houses out of legos or balsa wood bridges for engineering competitions.</p>

    	<h3>Education</h3>
    	<p>I attended high school at Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts. At Deerfield, I learned from a ton of great teachers and was challenged by talented peers on a daily basis. After breaking my arm in my first soccer match, I turned to running to stay in shape. I ended up being a better runner than soccer player and ultimately decided to attend Brown. I graduated from Brown in 2012 with a bachelor's in economics and was also lucky enough to set a school record in track.</p>

    	<h3>Work Experience</h3>
    	<p>After graduation, I took some time off and traveled around Europe. I decided to take an internship on the product management team at a start up in Austin (my knowledge of coding at the time was limited to the intro to CS course I took senior year in college). My company grew from 40 to over 100 people in the year I was there, I got promoted to associate product manager, and we merged with another Austin start up. More importantly, I grew to love technology; prompting me to move to San Francisco to fully immerse myself in the tech world. I've been in the Bay Area for almost 3 years now, spending most of that time at Box on the marketing operations team and later Online Sales - a new team at Box dedicated to selling without human interaction.</p>

    	<p style="padding: 20px 0 0 0">I've noticed a couple of things that have inspired me to join a program like General Assembly. First, I've witnessed what Marc Andreessen famously said a few years ago, "software is eating the world." Even traditional business functions like sales and marketing are becoming incredibly automated, and I have experienced this shift first hand. <i>I want to understand and create the increasingly digital world around me.</i> Additionally, through my limited exposure to programing and working with engineers, I've really enjoyed it. I feel a huge sense of satisfaction akin to the one I got playing with Legos growing up.</p>
